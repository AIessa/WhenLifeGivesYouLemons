# When Life Gives You Lemons

When Life Gives You Lemons is a computer game (in development) that is designed for autistic girls between 10-16 years. It is meant to support them in improving their socio-emotional skills and self confidence in dealing with emotions and the social interactions of every day life.

## About the repository
This repository currently contains the c# code used in the Unity project and some examples for YarnSpinner (dialogue) scripts. This repository has a wiki, which contains some documentation on custom Yarn Commands and Yarn Functions that were used to manipulate the game's behaviour from within dialogues.
